# ExOtp

ExOtp allows you to create One-Time-Passwords, which can be either Time-based One-Time Passwords(TOTP) and Counter based OTPs(via HMAC-based One Time Passwords(HOTP)). 

The library is primarily based on the [PyOTP](https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp), and almost exactly mirrors their API as well. It follows the MFA standards defined in [RFC4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226)(HOTP: an Hmac-Based One-Time Password Algorithm) and [RFC6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238)(TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm).

The library provides the following features:

- Generate TOTP or Counter based HOTP
- Generate QR codes for OTPs
- Generate random secret values(if required)

The full documentation is available [here](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_otp/).

## Installation

You can install `ex_otp` by adding it to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_otp, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

### TOTP

- You can create a TOTP object using either a random secret or  a user-provided secret as follows:
```elixir
secret = ExOtp.random_secret()
#=> "uapgaiacdaptafbu"
totp = ExOtp.create_totp(secret, 30) # Specify interval for which the OTP will be valid.
#=> %ExOtp.Totp{
#  base: %ExOtp.Base{
#    digest: :sha,
#    digits: 6,
#    secret: "OVQXAZ3BNFQWGZDBOB2GCZTCOU======"
#  },
#  interval: 30
#}
```

- You can then generate an otp using the `totp` object, for a given datetime value:
```elixir
otp = ExOtp.generate_totp(totp, DateTime.utc_now())
#=> "967372"
```

- Finally, you can check if the otp is valid using the `otp` and `totp` objects:

```elixir
ExOtp.valid_totp?(totp, otp, DateTime.utc_now())
#=> true
```

### HOTP

- Create a HOTP object using either a random secret or  a user-provided secret as follows:
```elixir
secret = ExOtp.random_secret()
counter = 30
#=> "uapgaiacdaptafbu"
hotp = ExOtp.create_hotp(secret, counter) # Specify initial count 
#=> %ExOtp.Hotp{
#  base: %ExOtp.Base{
#    digest: :sha,
#    digits: 6,
#    secret: "OVQXAZ3BNFQWGZDBOB2GCZTCOU======"
#  },
#  initial_count: 30
#}
```

- Generate an otp using the `hotp` object, for a given datetime value:
```elixir
otp = ExOtp.generate_hotp(hotp, counter)
#=> "268374"
```

- Finally, you can check if the otp is valid using the `otp` and `hotp` objects:

```elixir
ExOtp.valid_hotp?(hotp, otp, counter) # Specify counter value
#=> true
```

### QR Code(Optional)

- Generate the provision URI for use with a QR code scanner built into MFA apps such as Google Authenticator.
- Generate the QR code using the `EQRCode` libraby, which is an optional dependency.
- Given a `totp` object and an `otp`, you can generate the QR code using:

```elixir

totp
|> ExOtp.provision_uri_totp(otp, "test:shubham@google.com",issuer_name: "test")
|> ExOtp.generate_qr_code("code.svg")
#=> 09:51:17.102 [info]  QR code written to file: code.svg
```

### Coverage

- Generate the coverage report using following mix task:
```elixir
MIX_ENV=test mix excoveralls
```

## Credits
- [PyOTP](https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp) - The API and implementation is largely based on PyOTP.
- [Nimble TOTP](https://github.com/dashbitco/nimble_totp) by Dashbit.
    - Generally, I used this library to check the correctness of my implementation, and also borrowed their implementation for generating the QR code :) 
    - Their library supports a few optional features, which are missing in `ex_otp` for now.
    - I also aim to add benchmarks tests comparing our libraries in the near future!
